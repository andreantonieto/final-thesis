# final-thesis
My final thesis for my graduation course Computer Engineering. 

This final project was developed to send commands to a controller through serial communication
using an embedded system and IoT (Internet of Things) technology. Embedded
systems are systems with functions and resources projected specifically for a particular
purpose. The embedded sensing is a system property that measure, identify and evaluate
itself or its environment situation. Both concepts are used in this project to make the
industrial automation possible. To make the industrial automation it is necessary to use
the serial communication, which is the data transfer bit by bit from one system to other.
This data transfer is performed with IoT technology, that purposed was send information
using web protocol for a controller board which was responsible to manager a digital
controller that used real time of execution. At the end, we obtained a complete system
capable of manipulate as it was programmed.
